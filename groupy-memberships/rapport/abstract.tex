Abstract content

Overall layout is changed in report.tex. This is also the main file when you try to compile. As this file is responsible for overall layout, you will add more chapters in this file when needed.

The first page is changed in titlePage.tex

ref.bib is the bibliography file

Some advanced and language specific stuff is in init.tex

If you don't like liks to be visible (they are blue or red now) this can be change in the hypersetup section (in init.tex)

It may take a while for you to get this file to work. You might need to install a few more latex packages before it works.
