% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
%   \graphicspath{{./res}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
%   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx
\usepackage{listings}




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\IEEEPARstart{U}{sing} a distributed hash table is quite common to store key value pairs in a system where we want to increase our throughput and also have data redundancy if one node/server in the system goes down. To create this system we based our architecture on the chord scheme which describes a distributed hash table with a guaranteed lookup complexity of $ O(lg(n)) $ where n is the number of nodes in the system. 

% TODO add description of paper structure!

\subsection{Architecture}
The complete architecture of the chord protocol and structure is quite complex and can be studied in more details in the original paper \cite{chord-sigcomm}. In this section we instead introduce some of the most basic concepts that are needed to understand the design of the simplified system that was created during this lab.

Chord is based on a structure where all nodes in the system are connected to form a ring structure. To increase performance we also add interconnections in this cycle as this makes it possible to route messages more efficiently between nodes that lay further away from each other. 

To simplify this structure this experiment removed parts unnecessary to create a working implementation. This meant that things like multiple connections between nodes in different parts of the ring where omitted. Because of this our implementation has at best a complexity of $ O(n) $ which is way worse that what you would expect from this type of system. This structure is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:diagram} which also shows the extra connections used to retain the system structure in the case of a node crash. This is described in more details later in the report.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{res/diagram}
	\caption{Sturcture of circle in the simplified chord architecture}
	\label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Ordering and data storage}
All nodes and data values in the system has a unique identifier (provided by the \textit{key}-modules). In the current version this is a randomly generated number from 0 - 1 000 000 000 to provide a somewhat even distribution in the network by statistical chance. Another solution to this distribution problem would be to have a hash of a human readable values as the key. This would have approximately the same effect by distributing keys and nodes evenly across different nodes. 

To find a key for a data value in the system we must distribute them according to some rule that is easy to follow back to a specific node. In this architecture we make each node responsible for all keys greater of equal to the key from itself up to the key just below the next node in the system. When a new value is inserted into the network the receiving node will compare the key according to this rule and if it does not match, the key-value pair is forwarded to the rest of the network. It is important to notice that node \textit{20} will be responsible for all keys up to \textit{4} in figure \ref{fig:diagram}. Because of this the comparison between two keys takes the following form:

\begin{lstlisting}
between(_, From, From) ->
	true;
between(Key, From, To) ->
	((Key > From) and (Key =< To))
	or ((Key > From) and (To < From))
	or ((Key =< To) and (From > To)).
\end{lstlisting}

By using this comparison mechanism the nodes in the system can also automatically detect when they are connected out of order and correct this by talking to each other. By looking at their unique identifiers they will over time try to organize themselves by exchanging node pointers over time. This functionality can be further reviewed in the code that comes with this report. One problem here is that the ordering process requires quite a lot of messages which we try to keep to a minimum because of performance reasons. Therefore the nodes will only periodically send out order comparison messages to each other to check if any new changes can be detected in the network. If the system is very volatile with nodes frequently joining and leaving the network this period must be quite short to have any use of the nodes that otherwise just would be out of order in the system and prevent search algorithms from operating efficiently. 

This automatic stabilization procedure makes it possible to add new nodes at any point in the system and just have the automatically find their stop in the network.

\subsection{Protection from crashes}
Because of the ring structure we have a large problem if any node in the system crashes. All nodes in this type of architecture is equally important (which is one of the points of building it this way) which also means that it is equally bad if any of them crashes as this creates a line of connected node instead of a cycle where messages can be routed and all nodes reached. 

To solve this problem all nodes in the system has two references of successor nodes. We also take advantage of the built in monitor tools in Erlang to perform this task. All nodes has a reference to their actual successor which they monitor for crashes. The second reference is to their successor's successor which is the reference pointer illustrated in grey in figure \ref{fig:diagram}. In the case of their successor crashing, they will detect this using the monitor functionality of Erlang and immediately change pointer for succeeding node to the one in front of the crashed. This effectively closes the gap in the ring caused by the node that no longer responds.

\section{Further development}
As previously mentioned this implementation of Chord is not really relevant for production as it lacks many of the parts that will make it a efficient system. The main parts that need further development are discussed in the sections below.

\subsection{Redundant data}
In this type of system we are both trying to create a system where we can produce a certain amount of throughput as well as some kind of data redundancy. This means that we want to be able to access a key value pair inserted into the system, even if the responsible node were to crash. As it is quite likely for one server to receive more traffic than others depending on the use case this is something we must expect in a production system. To solve this problem data must be replicated in the system and stored in more than one place and moved to a new responsible node in case any node in the system dies. The current implementation has the ability to automatically distribute data in the system as new nodes join, but this mechanic is only built to handle the task of moving active data to the new responsible node.

\subsection{Routing and finger tables}
Another problem with this implementation is the efficiency. The original version of the chord (as described in the paper) has a guaranteed complexity of $ O(lg(n)) $. This on the other hand only has one connection to the subsequent node in the ring which means that messages must be routed around the entire ring just to reach the node behind the current (ignoring the fact that our implementation keeps a reference to previous node as well as this is not used for this reason). This means that we have a linear complexity which if far from ideal when dealing with a large number of nodes.

In the implementation of chord described in the original paper this is solved by a finger table that each node is responsible to maintain. This table has a reference to nodes in the ring at logarithmically increasing lengths (e.g. node 1 has a reference to node nr 2, 4, 8, ...). This means that we have many bindings to nodes close to us but still have the opportunity to ge to other parts of the network quickly (which can route our message to the final destination). The proof that his gives a operation complexity of $ O(lg(n)) $ can be found in the original paper \cite{chord-sigcomm}.

\subsection{Retaining the ring structure in failures}
The last problem discussed in this report has to do with the failure resistance of the system. In the current state the system is able to recover from singe node failures and can rebuild the node network without a problem. But as soon as we get a crash of two succeeding nodes this system will no longer hold as we don not have pointer to more nodes than this.

In the original protocol for chord we still have pointers (from our finger table) to other parts of the network which means that we can easily close any gaps in the system by just changing the pointer to any of the other nodes we know of.
