\chapter{Improvements}
There are many possible improvements for this server as it is quite rudimentary. The proposed extra tasks are all needed if we are going to create a server ready for production use. If we instead focus on my main goal, increasing productivity, the main problem here seems to be the requests that are timing out or taking a very long time to finish. One potential solution to this is to prevent the main loop from accepting more connections when we do not have any free workers. This would make the number of active connections drop to the same as the number of workers which possibly would make the connections more reliable as we are actively handling all incoming tcp connections instead of just letting them be there before we have time to complete the requests.

Another problem with this server is related DDOS attacks. As it only serves (and reads) from a fixed number of connections it is very easy to block any new users from connecting by just setting up this number of connections and send data slowly to prevent TCP time-outs. This means that the attacker does not have to have a lot of resources to effectively block the server entirely.
